Data Scientist @ Webin Infosoft Pvt. Ltd.
• Performed data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on large datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL, delivering actionable
insights for business decision-making.
• Performed web scraping and extracted structured data from diverse websites using BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and Chromium
WebDriver for downstream analytics and machine learning tasks.
• Built and optimized ML pipelines with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, improving model accuracy and reducing latency.
• Built a Predictive model and implemented NLP-based solutions for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and text classification using
Hugging Face Transformers and spaCy.
• Implemented an AI-powered chatbot using Python, FastAPI, and NLP libraries to enable intelligent, real-time user interactions. Integrated
The chatbot with external APIs and databases for dynamic responses and uses embeddings and vector search for contextual understanding.
Ensured scalable deployment with Docker and optimized performance for production use.
• Utilized PyMongo with MongoDB for efficient query optimization, schema design, and high-performance data access.
• Designed workflow automation pipelines using n8n, integrating with APIs and databases for multi-step automation.
• Explored model fine-tuning or inference optimization, like quantization and batching
• Deployed models on Google Cloud and AWS, using Cloud Run, EC2, and SageMaker, ensuring scalability and low-latency inference.
This aligns directly with their requirement for cloud-native ML workloads.
